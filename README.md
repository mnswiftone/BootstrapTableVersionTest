# BootstrapTableVersionTest
Demo a problem displaying Bootstrap-table after version update
Created a VS2017 ASP.NET 4.61 simple web-site solution containing two web pages 
to view how my favorite bootstrap-table app (https://github.com/wenzhixin/bootstrap-table)
is not showing correctly on a recent version.

Uploaded this in response to usual request for sample code when 
reporting an issue as I did https://github.com/wenzhixin/bootstrap-table/issues/4168

Web pages include CSS and JS references for Bootstrap and related JS files, JQuery, and Bootstrap-table mentioned above.
